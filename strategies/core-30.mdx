<Note>
**Objective**
The central premise of Core 30 is that the **website structure must exactly match the Google Business Profile (GBP)** to build trust and authority. The goal of every URL created is solely to rank the GBP higher, not necessarily to rank the pages organically.
</Note>

## Strategy Breakdown

The "Core 30" refers to creating ~30 dedicated pages that perfectly mirror the services and categories listed on the GBP. This creates a tight semantic match between your digital entities.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Phase 1: GBP Optimization" icon="store">
    Before building the site, maximize the content and categorization of the client's Google Business Profile.

    1. **Primary Category**: Select the single most important service (e.g., *Plumber*).
    2. **Secondary Categories**: Select 3-5 highly relevant categories (e.g., *Drain Services Provider*, *Gas Contractor*).
    3. **Services**: Add **20-30 specific services**. Unlike categories, these are custom text entries (e.g., *Tankless Water Heater Installation*).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Phase 2: Website Structure (3 Layers)" icon="sitemap">
    Construct the website to mirror the GBP in three distinct layers.

    ### Layer 1: The GBP Landing Page (Homepage)
    *   **Definition**: The URL listed in the "Website" field on the GBP.
    *   **Target Keyword**: Primary Category + City Name (e.g., *"Plumber Houston"*).
    *   **Role**: Acts as the linking hub.

    ### Layer 2: Secondary Category Pages
    *   **Content**: ~1,500 words optimized for Category + City Name (e.g., *"Water Heater Houston"*).
    *   **Linking Rule**: The homepage must link to these via **plain text links in the body copy**, NOT just the navigation bar.
    *   **Structure**: These pages list all specific services relevant to that category as subheadings.

    ### Layer 3: Deep Service Pages
    *   **Content**: Deep, long-form page dedicated exclusively to one specific service.
    *   **Linking**: Linked from the Layer 2 Category Page under the corresponding subheading (with a 60-70 word intro).
    *   **SEO Goal**: The Title Tag and H1 must match the specific GBP service name exactly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Phase 3: Trust & Relevance" icon="link">
    Build authority through strategic external linking and hyper-local content.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Trust Signals (Backlinks)" icon="shield-check">
        **1. PBN Links (Foundation)**
        *   **Quantity**: One link to every Core 30 page (30 total).
        *   **Purpose**: Signal to Google that content is not "raw AI slop". These do not build rank but validate existence.

        **2. High-Quality Local Trust Links (Rank Builders)**
        *   **Primary Source**: Local Chamber of Commerce.
        *   **Secondary Sources**: Sponsorships (Little League, Charities, Local Events).
        *   **Target**: These links should point to the **GBP Landing Page** (Homepage).
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Geographical Relevance" icon="location-dot">
        *Required for highly competitive markets (e.g., Chicago).*

        *   **Targeting**: Neighborhoods where the client ranks #4 or #5.
        *   **Content**: "Service + Neighborhood + City" (e.g., *"Plumber Conquered Hills Fort Wayne"*).
        *   **Details**: Include driving directions from that neighborhood to the GBP address, local weather, and specific local projects.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Phase 4: AI & Voice Search Readiness" icon="robot">
    Optimize for ChatGPT, Bing, and Apple Maps.

    *   **Bing for Business**: Essential for ChatGPT recognition (since it uses Bing's index).
    *   **Citations**: NAP (Name, Address, Phone) must be character-perfect across Bing, Apple Maps, and Yelp. Use tools like *Lead Snap*.
    *   **Schema Markup**: Feed specific data (settlements, specialties) via Schema, as LLMs read labels, not just links.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Content Writing Guidelines

### Core Mission
Write content that dominates both traditional Google search rankings AND gets recommended by AI systems like ChatGPT and Google's AI overview.

You are creating content for a [Primary Service] company homepage targeting "[Primary Service] [City]" that ranks #1 on Google Maps while also being the type of content AI systems trust and recommend.

### Optimization Guidelines

**For Google Algorithm:**
- Use target keyword in title, H1, and first paragraph
- Include each GBP secondary category or GBP service as exact-match H2 headings
- Maintain keyword density around 1-2% for primary keyword
- Include local SEO signals (neighborhood names, local landmarks, service areas)
- Use proper heading structure (H1, H2, H3) for content hierarchy
- Include semantic keywords related to the primary service industry

**For AI Systems:**
- Sound like genuine recommendations from a trusted local expert
- Use natural, conversational language that matches how people actually talk
- Answer real questions people ask: "Who's the best [primary service] near me?" "What do I do if [common problem]?"
- Include authentic local knowledge and community connections
- Share helpful advice, not just sales pitches
- Use the exact words customers use when describing their problems

### Balanced Writing Approach
- Start each section with natural, conversational language, then include technical keyword optimization
- **Example**: "Last winter, half of [local neighborhood] called us when [common problem happened]. Here's what we learned about emergency [primary service] services in [City]..."
- Follow storytelling with clear service descriptions that include exact keyword matches
- Balance helpful advice with service-focused content

### Content Structure
- **H1**: Exact match primary keyword in conversational context
- **H2s**: Each GBP secondary category or GBP service as exact match, but introduced naturally
- **Opening**: Relatable local story or common problem
- **Body**: Mix of helpful advice and keyword-optimized service descriptions
- **Service Integration**: Naturally mention all listed GBP services within relevant sections
- **Local Elements**: Specific neighborhoods, seasonal issues, community involvement

### Language Guidelines
- Write at 5th grade reading level
- Use short, clear sentences
- Balance conversational tone with keyword requirements
- Include both technical terms (for Google) and plain language explanations (for AI)
- Sound helpful and expert, not robotic or overly salesy

### Words to Avoid
Avoid: embark, look no further, navigating, picture this, top-notch, unleash, unlock, unveil, we've got you covered, transition, transitioning, crucial, delve, daunting, deep dive, dive in, realm, ensure, in conclusion, in summary, optimal, assessing, firstly, strive, striving, furthermore, moreover, comprehensive, we know, we understand, testament, captivating, eager, refreshing, edge of my seat, breath of fresh air, breath of fresh, to consider, it is important to consider, there are a few considerations, it's essential to, vital, it's important to note, it should be noted, to sum up, secondly, lastly, in terms of, with regard to, it's worth mentioning, it's interesting to note, significantly, notably, essentially, as such, therefore, thus, interestingly, in essence, noteworthy, bear in mind, it's crucial to note, one might argue, it's widely acknowledged, predominantly, from this perspective, in this context, this demonstrates, arguably, it's common knowledge, undoubtedly, this raises the question, in a nutshell, unveiled

### Quality Signals for Both Systems
- Demonstrate real local expertise and community knowledge
- Include specific, helpful information that solves actual problems
- Reference seasonal or area-specific issues related to the primary service
- Show genuine business history and community involvement
- Provide value beyond just listing services

### Success Metric
Content should feel natural enough that AI systems recommend it, while being optimized enough that Google ranks it in the top 3 map results.

## Implementation Checklist for Developers

When building a StokeLeads site, ensure you follow this exact hierarchy:

1.  **Map the GBP**: Get the list of 1 Primary Category, 5 Secondary Categories, and 30 Services.
2.  **Create URLs**:
    *   `domain.com/` (Target: Primary Category)
    *   `domain.com/secondary-category-1`
    *   `domain.com/secondary-category-1/service-1`
    *   ...
3.  **Interlink**: Ensure Layer 1 -> Layer 2 links are **in the text**.
4.  **Validate**: Ensure H1s match GBP service names 1:1.
